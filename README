RailsConsole
============

This is a web based ruby/rails console plugin, that you can use to get (nearly) same functionality you have on Rails' own ./script/console. 

NOTE: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! Don't use this on your production apps unless you've thought of it for about 10 times. No, make it 100.

How To Install
=======

./script/plugin install git://github.com/j4s0n/rails_console.git

How To Use
=======

Add this on your routes.rb

map.console '/console', :controller => 'rails_console'
map.console_execute '/console/execute', :controller => 'rails_console', :action => 'execute'


Then Access your site

http://foo.bar/console


TODO:
======

- white list the params[:command]
- override allow_request? just to make sure only YOU can access that controller
