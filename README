RailsConsole
============

NOTE: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! Don't use this on your production apps.

How To Use
=======

Add this on your routes.rb

map.console '/console', :controller => 'rails_console'
map.console_execute '/console/execute', :controller => 'rails_console', :action => 'execute'


Then Access your site

http://foo.bar/console





TODO:

- white list the params[:command]
- override allow_request? just to make sure only YOU can access that controller
